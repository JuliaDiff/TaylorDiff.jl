# TaylorDiff

[![Build Status](https://github.com/tansongchen/TaylorDiff.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/tansongchen/TaylorDiff.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This project start from [TaylorSeries.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/TaylorSeries.jl) and re-implement the Taylor mode automatic differentiation primarily for high-order differentiation in solving ODEs and PDEs.
